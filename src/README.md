The codebase productionizes the [ABC workflow](https://github.com/broadinstitute/ABC-Enhancer-Gene-Prediction) for execution in [redun](https://github.com/insitro/redun).  

Examples of executing the various tasks are in the [tests](tests) folder.  

The run the full wokflow start to finish, execute the task 'workflow' in the file `run_abc.py`.  

The example workflow included with the ABC codebase is reproduced by executing the script `tests/test_run_abc.sh`.
